ardour-build.sh is a script used to build Ardour in various configurations
where each configuration is contained in a separate build directory.

To use these scripts, place this repository adjacent to your Ardour
repository/ies and configure and build using pre-defined configurations.

For instance:

$ ./ardour-build.sh configure debug

$ ./ardour-build.sh build debug

A list of configurations can be listed with:

$ ./ardour-build.sh -l

The result of the build will be located in the BUILD directory in the
form:

$ARDOUR_SRC_DIR_NAME-$ARDOUR_BRANCH-$ARDOUR_BUILD_CONFIG

This may be something like:

BUILD/ardour-master-debug

BUILD/ardour-cool-branch-optimize-debug

BUILD/altardour-world-peace-debug-tests
